%I am writing in response to the advertised Support Engineer position at Mapbox. This opportunity seems to be an intersection where my experience and my interest collide. After I stumbled onto the Mapbox website during a routine job search, I became interested in the company for several reasons. Firstly, the technology was impressive but what also caught my eye was the fast-paced environment that Mapbox seems to inhabit as well as the heavy contribution to the open-source community, including the mapbox/shelf-pack structure on GitHub, which introduced me to the conundrum that is time complexity of the bin packing problem. When I reached the Jobs section of the website I became particularly interested in the Support Engineer position. 
%
%The description of the position placed an emphasis on the breadth of responsibilities for this role. I have always found positions with a wide range of activities to be rewarding and interesting. I have also found that they help me develop faster, both professionally and personally. Responsibilities such as development, writing technical documentation, interacting with customers, and automating internal process are all tasks that I have experience with and enjoy greatly.
%
%In my limited time researching Mapbox products, I have been thoroughly impressed with the Mapbox GL JS library as well as the Mapbox Command Line Interface, the latter of which inspired me to begin refactoring a command line utility I wrote in college to include the Python click package, which, in its beginning stages, can be found here: https://github.com/JohnVanNote/cd-flatfile-database/tree/click. I am fasciated by the opportunity to work in an open-sourced environment alongside developers who were able to build and maintain these tools and products.

%In addition to my technical background, I feel one of my greatest values to the position is my experience in customer-facing roles. From October 2014 until late January 2015 I worked as a Technical Support Engineer for Solve Media, Inc., where the focus of my work was responding to customer inquiries about technical implementation of the products, a series of open-source libraries for CAPTCHA type-in advertising. The time I spent working with developers to solve issues with technical implementation of code, both client- and server-side, is applicable to this opportunity. Upon leaving the position at Solve Media, I was fortunate to receive recommendations from both my direct superior and the CIO, which can be found on my LinkedIn profile.

%My current position is comparable to the Support Engineer position, as I have worked as a member of the infrastructure team, with a focus in operations since March 2015. I am responsible for the primary support of a number of development teams in tasks including application upgrades, responding to customer application issues, and resolving unforeseen operational roadblocks. In this case my customers tend to be developers within the organization, and despite their technical proficiency, the divide between development and operations leaves many who are unfamiliar with internal processes and procedures. Therefore, a high level of empathy is needed when offering support. Internally at this position, I have received formal written praise from customers.

%I am interested in the Support Engineer position at Mapbox because the products I have seen are truly impressive and I am certain that I can contribute in a meaningful way. My resume is included. I appreciate the consideration; please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.
