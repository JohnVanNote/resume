\section{Experience}
\cventry{Mar. 2017 - Current}{Senior Software Engineer, Identity \& Access Management}{Ernst \& Young (acquired from Sila Solutions Group December 2019)}{Arlington, VA}{}{
  \textit{Technologies used: Java, Apache Tomcat, SQL, Vagrant, Git, Jenkins, AWS.}%
  \begin{itemize}%
        \item Lead the design and development of complex integrations with third-party Identity \& Access Management (IAM) solutions. This was coded primarily in Java using TestNG/EasyMock for unit testing, and Vagrant/Docker for integration testing.
        \item Designed the high-level architecture for a resume parsing application, following a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. The application leveraged ReactJS for the front end, Spring Boot for the business logic, ElasticSearch for data storage, and Jenkins for build automation.
        \item Implemented practice-wide code standardization practices including automation, code review methodology, telemetry, and test procedures.
        \item Mentored and trained over twenty junior software developers including entry-level and experienced hires.
      \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Mar. 2015 - Mar. 2017}{Software Support Engineer}{Corporation Service Company}{Wilmington, DE}{}{
  \textit{Technologies used: Java/Groovy, Python, BASH, Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, IIS, Oracle WebLogic, SQL, Git, VirtualBox.}%
  \begin{itemize}%
        \item Designed and developed a Groovy application, which automated a previously manually-compiled monthly application performance index. The application aggregated data from multiple reporting tools leveraging the Splunk SDK for Java and reading from an Oracle 11g database backend.
        \item Engineered and supported the implementation of enterprise ETL and Business Intelligence Reporting tools across four environments, spanning more than fourteen application servers. Participated in planning, configuration, and troubleshooting of all server-side decisions.
        \item Automated reporting processes using VBA, which parsed data and generated charts in Microsoft Excel with a single click as opposed to a manual process.
        \item Developed a solution to remediate application latency in an Apache Tomcat application by creating an extensible custom Python library to execute BASH commands on Linux servers. 
        \item Authored a variety of BASH scripts to common Linux/Solaris server issues.
      \end{itemize}
