  \begin{itemize}%
        \item Served as the technical lead on several IGA platform implementations, using Java to build customizations on the SailPoint IdentityIQ (IIQ) solution across clients in the retail, housing, pharmaceutical, and insurance industries.
        \item Drove the adoption of unit testing practices on multiple projects, leveraging the TestNG and EasyMock testing frameworks, to reduce code duplication, lower risk associated with code refactoring, and reduce the number of bugs.
        \item Automated the deployment and upgrade processes using a Jenkins pipeline and Artifactory for shorter, smaller, and more frequent deployments.
        \item Designed the architecture for a resume parsing application using a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern with a ReactJS front end, Java/Spring Boot back end, ElasticSearch data storage, and Jenkins/Maven build automation.
        \item Contributor to a series of internal development tools and libraries, primarily responsible for code maintenance, developing enhancements, unit testing coverage, and code reviews of new features.
        \item Managed multiple development work streams using release- and feature-based branching models.
        \item Used the feature flag software development technique to decouple feature deployment from feature release.
        \item Trained to over 70 junior engineers by providing guidance and participating in code quality reviews.
        \item Integrated IIQ with several down stream systems, including: Active Directory, LDAP (389 DS, ADLDS, OpenLDAP), MainFrame (CA Top Secret, IBM System i, RACF), JDBC (Microsoft SQL, MySQL, Oracle PL/SQL), Okta, SAP (BusinessObjects, ERP, Portal, SRM), Workday, and REST APIs.

        \item Engineered and supported the implementation of enterprise ETL and Business Intelligence Reporting tools across four environments, spanning more than fourteen application servers.
        \item Automated reporting processes using VBA, which parsed data and generated charts in Microsoft Excel with a single click.
        \item Developed a solution to remediate application latency in an Apache Tomcat application by creating an extensible custom solution in Python to execute Shell commands on Linux servers.
