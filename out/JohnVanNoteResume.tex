        \item Led the technical implementation of an IGA platform leveraging SailPoint IdentityIQ (IIQ) across multiple clients in the retail, housing, pharmaceutical, and insurance industries.
        \item Designed the migration of custom business processes such as Lifecycle Event Management (LCM), account creation, and access management, including using the feature flag software development technique to decouple the deployment of functionality from its release.

        \item Drove the adoption of a team-wide unit testing framework, leveraging the TestNG and EasyMock testing frameworks, to reduce code duplication and improve confidence in refactoring and bug fixing.
        \item Designed the high-level architecture for a resume parsing application, following a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern that leveraged ReactJS for the front end, Spring Boot for the business logic, ElasticSearch for data storage, and Jenkins for build automation.
        \item Managed multiple workstreams via a release and feature branching model leveraging git for distributed version-control.
        \item Contributor to a series of EY internal development projects, primarily responsible for code maintenance, developing enhancements, unit testing coverage, and code reviews of new features.
        \item Provided training to over 70 consultants via the EY internal training program by providing guidance and participating in code reviews.
        \item Integrated IIQ with several down stream systems, including: 389 Directory Server, Active Directory, ADLDS, CA Top Secret, IBM System i, Microsoft SQL Server Database (JDBC), MySQL Server Database (JDBC), Okta, Oracle Database (JDBC), RACF, SAP BusinessObjects, SAP ERP, SAP Portal, SAP SRM, Workday, and various RESTful web services.

        \item Engineered and supported the implementation of enterprise ETL and Business Intelligence Reporting tools across four environments, spanning more than fourteen application servers.
        \item Automated reporting processes using VBA, which parsed data and generated charts in Microsoft Excel with a single click as opposed to a manual process.
