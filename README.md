# Resume
This the source code for my resume in LaTeX and also the functionality to support a cover letter.

## Building
In order to build my resume as a pdf, run the following:
```
make resume
```

You can skip this, and view my resume by running:
```
make view
```

## LaTeX
The LaTeX modules for Resume and Cover Letter originated here, I editted them to my liking, but all credit here, I am not experienced in LaTeX:
