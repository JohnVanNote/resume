# Resume

This the source code for my resume in LaTeX and also the functionality to support a cover letter.

## Building

In order to build my resume as a pdf, run the following:
```
make resume
```

You can skip this, and view my resume by running:
```
make view
```
## Technologies Used

### Lombok

Project Lombok is a build tool used to reduce boilerplate code in java see [here] (https://projectlombok.org/). I'm a little iffy on if I 
should use it because it requires a plugin for IntelliJ to prevent my IDE from yelling at me. But for now, it's part of the project.

### LaTeX
The LaTeX modules for Resume and Cover Letter originated here, I edited them to my liking, but all credit here, I am not experienced in LaTeX:
